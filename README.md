# Live ISS Tracker Application

The application is a simple dashboard using python which lets you track the location of the International Space station in real-time.

This app is deployed on https://share.streamlit.io/.

Also this project is adapted from my oringal project hosted in <a href="https://gitlab.com/manojm18/liveisstracker"><img src="https://about.gitlab.com/images/press/logo/png/gitlab-logo-gray-stacked-rgb.png" alt="drawing" align="center" width="50"/></a>, which uses docker containers (app + mysql) integrated with Gitlab's CI/CD
